/**
 *
 * Unique Hashing implementation inspired by djb2/fnv1a algorithms,
 * where we are not concerned with the hash being decoded.
 * Focuses on speed while maintaining good hash distribution
 *
 * Note: We could also use something like Murmurhash instead
 * https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/blob/master/imurmurhash.js
 *
 * @param {any} input - Value to hash
 * @returns {string} - Hash in hex format
